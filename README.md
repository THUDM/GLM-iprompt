  Question: What causes the fall of USA?
  Answer: 
  The cause can be seen from the following graph. It shows that USA is in fact falling down. One should notice the change in USA's position over the last few decades, since these changes ultimately lead up to its 2014 collapse! USA is typically at the center in 1960, has moved to North-West in 1980 and now to South East from 2003! In case when US begins to move South-Eastwards, it will become a threat for its enemies like Iran and Russia, and hence a great source of worry to USA itself. Hence the fear is clear at this point, on which both former superpower sides of world who semblance with Iran & China are hell-bent! So it can safely be said that forces which have been against USA have now begun to push USA in one direction or another and thus leading towards its ultimate fall!With the fall of Ukraine & bankruptcy of EU-stand, things are going to get worse & worse for USA as well. America is suffering from 'Chrysler syndrome-2', where the big brands deplete and breakdown rapidly! Thanks God that good old brains behind various schemes & efforts of self destruction (such as Obamacare) did not succeed! Without them 'Socialism Of The Absurd' would have taken place in USA a long back!

Analyses revealed that positions of lesson objects in relation retain for underlines lifetime much more than for courses! Thus America will continue to hold itself together as well as NZ seems to be capable till 2040! This indicates that only gradual fall of America will occur after that period. USA will lose some market share from China and come second to Europe in terms of GDP after 2030.
